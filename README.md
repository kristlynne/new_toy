BrightSpell

Bright Spell is a sustainable living application, which allows users to set their own goals and track progress on those goals from day to day. Animations evolve along with user progress. Built in Ruby on Rails with React, Flex-box and SCSS for front-end.
Climate change is such a massive problem that many individuals feel overwhelmed and powerless to prevent it. This app was designed to bring sustainable living back into the personal scope of daily life. Rewards in the form of animations bring in a game quality, positively reinforcing milestones along the way.
